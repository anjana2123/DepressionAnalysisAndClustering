# DepressionAnalysisAndClustering
General mental health analysis and getting the unaware, informed of the seriousness of the situation (by the range scale), its consequences and the follow-ups for the betterment.

Some people with depression may try to hide the signs from others, and others might not even realize that they have
depression. Although well-known symptoms such as sadness or hopelessness can be easy to recognize, there are also
other hidden signs of depression. So as of a general mental health analysis we would take a responsibility in getting
the unaware informed of the seriousness of the situation(by the range scale) ,its consequences and the follow-ups for
the betterment.
