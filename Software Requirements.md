## Software requirements / Various sub components

The project which is still in its developing stage will require several software platforms to achieve its success.
1. **PEBL** The primary software around which the project revolves around is PEBL (The Psychology Experiment
Building Language). PEBL offers a simple programming language tailor-made for creating and conducting
many standard experiments. It is Free software, licensed under the GPL, with both the compiled executables
and source code available without charge.
2. **GOOGLE** FORMS Initial collection of data using the battery features that we created using PEBL will be
collected using Google forms or excel sheets to use for clustering and ML modelling. It is planned to collect
psychometric data from all the students of our university and from the surroundings.
3. **PYTHON** LIBRARIES AND MODULES After collection of data, the next major step of our project is
to pre process the data, cleaning it, removing the outliers. Then we need to apply preferrable Machine Learning
clustering or grouping algorithms like random forests to group the responses of the data we have. This grouping
is mainly done to grade each cluster according to the recommended scales of depression prescribed by NIMHS.
All these data manipulation would be basically done using python modules like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib,
scikit, pyplot, seaborn.
4. **NLP** For the testing part of our model, we have planned to do web scrapping from open websites and social
media handles like Twitter. With the scrapped data, again we would tune our model. So, for the model to
understand text and image data, it is a necessary requirement to use Natural language processing and Image
processing.
5. **FRONT-END** After the performance of the model is optimum and fine-tuned, the next major task is to
develop and interactive website to put this idea to use. For the development of website, we would work on
HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, MONGODB.
